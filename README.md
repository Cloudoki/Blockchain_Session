# Blockchain_Session
Block chain demonstration session

## Block chain session
Technical reference (somewhat based on): https://github.com/seanjameshan/blockchain

## Session briefing
The blockchain session will attempt to demonstrate the technology workings by building a PoC blockchain application within a 1,5h timespan. The underlying blockchain will be visualised on screen, to see the effects of the application interactions. The PoC subject will be decided by Geert, before the session.
The building of the app will be limited to showcase interaction, setting up the name and data-fields. Each participant will have the opportunity to build their own application.

The aim of this session is to demonstrate the ease of use of this technology, countering some of the image of complexity surrounding blockchain.
No technical knowledge is required. A laptop with wifi access per participant is required.

As first phase:
-	A presentation on blockchain technology will be presented by Geert
-	The PoC case will be laid out to the participants


As second phase:
-	The visualisation of the blockchain will be activated
-	The genesis block will be created
-	The PoC web application interface will be explained to the participants


As third phase:
-	The participants will personalise their PoC application
-	The participants will be able to follow the block interactions on the shared screen
